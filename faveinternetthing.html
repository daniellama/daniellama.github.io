		fiftythree builds tools for mobile creation, such as paper -- an app that enables users to sketch, write, draw, outline, and color on the ipad. in their website, they use a technique called parallax scrolling, where the images and text are revealed when you scroll down the page. they use high quality photography to break apart the components of their new sophisticated tool for the ipad. parallax scrolling is a common trend, however, fiftythree used the effect in a cool and different way to showcase their product.
