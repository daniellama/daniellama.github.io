		After interviewing a few people, the common problem with the current MICA GD page is the absurd, blinding colors and not wanting to interact with the site anymore. However, after forcing themselves to get over the terrible color, navigation was not too difficult. There were just preference on getting rid of some things and making other things more prominent.

		<b>creative brief</b><p>
		Target: The MICA GD website is a resource for all MICA GD students. However, because of how poorly it is designed, it's purpose is more of a nuisance to the GD students and is usually immediately closed.<Br><br>
		Goals: To improve the eyesoreness, the website will lose all blinding colors. The GD banner covers up the content and articles, and in turn, loses the audience's interests. There will be a better organized top nav bar, but it will have a bigger presence on the site. The website will lose any obnoxious styling effects, and will have a more traditional presence. <br><Br>
		Theme: The content will be clean, minimal, and straightforward. The purpose of this resource is to be just that-a resource. Design should not be hindering the content's delivery.</p><br><br>

		<p>As a solution, I got rid of all colors and went with a simple and clean layout. I took inspiration from blog design since this site is a blog, and had the content laid out one at a time. However, instead of an endless scroll, I have posts organized by the last 5 posts made, to bring an extra level of organization.</p><br><Br>
